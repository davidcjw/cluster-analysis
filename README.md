# Cluster Analysis
Python library that generates useful cluster statistics for evaluation of clustering techniques.

The motivation behind the creation of this library is that there are not many libraries written in Python to validate the clusters that are generated by unsupervised learning methods like KMeans and Hierarchical clustering.

## Internal measures for cluster validation

The goal of clustering is to split data into clusters of objects, such that:
- the objects in the same cluster are similar as much as possible, and
- the objects in different clusters are highly distinct

This is equivalent to minimizing the intra-cluster distance and maximizing the inter-cluster distance.

Possible computed statistics for internal measures include the *Dunn Index*, *Silhouette coefficient* and other common metrics like average distance, median distance, etc.

## External measures for cluster validation

The aim is to compare the identified clusters to an external reference.

Possible computed statistics include the corrected *Rand Index* and *Meila's variation index VI*.

The corrected *Rand Index* varies from -1 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement).
